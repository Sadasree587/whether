- Search history (localStorage).
- Animated background that changes per weather category.

## Setup
1. Get a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/.
2. Open `js/main.js` and replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`.
3. Serve `index.html` (open in browser or use `live-server`).

## Notes
